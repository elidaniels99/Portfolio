Streamlit App:

Image Emotion Recognition:
Upload an image to detect and display emotions expressed in human faces. The app uses deep learning to recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, suprise, anger, disgust, neutral.

Live Webcam Emotion Detection:
Experience real-time emotion detection through your webcam. Toggle the webcam feed, and see your own emotions overlaid on the live video

    <p>Assist individuals in achieving their fitness goals by analyzing fitness activity through data from two distinct tracking devices, being Apple Watch vs Fitbit. Leveraging data from these devices, including health-related attributes, we will calculate BMI, combine user-specific insights and employ a predictive activity type model to create recommended fitness activities personalized to the individual to help them attain a BMI within the "normal" range.</p>

- K-Means Clustering Model to determine how the model would classify our known classifications of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese for optimized value of K.
- DBSCAN Model to compare the difference between the optimized value of K while comparing silhouette scores.
- Random Forests Model to predict activity type for users based on their fitness and health data.
